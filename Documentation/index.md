# Semiodesk Trinity
Trinity is an application development platform for Microsoft .NET and Mono. It allows to easily build 
Linked Data and Semantic Web applications based on the RDF metadata standard issued by the W3C. 
The API allows for developing first-class .NET applications with direct access to 
Linked Open Data repositories and knowledge bases such as DBPedia, Freebase, Geonames, BBC Business News, BBC Sports and many more.

## Benefits
Semiodesk Trinity is based on the Resource Description Framework (RDF) linked data platform,
which is an open standard maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
This means your data is vendor-independent and will be easily accessible and exchangable in many years to come.
Compared to many propriety graph databases, it has some considerable advantages:

* Standardized Graph Data Model  
  RDF extends the linking structure of the Word Wide Web to name things and the relationships between them. 
  Using this simple model, it allows structured and semi-structured data to be mixed, exposed, and shared across different applications.

* Ontologies: Class & Property Inheritance  
  Ontologies provide a powerful way to describe classes and their properties in RDF. 
  In contrast to many established data modelling frameworks, ontologies also allow to define inheritance relationships amongst properties. 
  Since ontologies are part of the data graph, this can happen during application rutime.

* Powerful & Intuitive Query Language
  Trinity supports Linq queries for your mapped objects. Developers familiar with this way of writing
  queries won't need to change their approach. For people who require more specialized query, it is always possible to use SPARQL.

* Logical Inferencing
  Ontologies provide rich knowledge about data structure, such as sub-class, sub-property hierarchies and about the transitivity
  of properties. Many RDF databases can make use of logical reasoning during application runtime to answer queries about
  facts which have not been explicitly saved.
